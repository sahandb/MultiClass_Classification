# Multi Class Classification
I applied one-vs-one and one-vs-all classification strategies using Logistic regression on the complete Iris dataset.

Then perform softmax regression on Iris dataset again and compare the results.

 I considered the first 80% of the data in each class for train and the rest 20% for test.
